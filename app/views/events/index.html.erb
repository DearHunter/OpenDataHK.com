            </div>
            <p><span class="lead-text">Open Data</span> is in its infancy in Hong Kong. On <span class="lead-text">18 & 19 May</span> you're invited to advance it in a weekend of design, prototypes and developing ideas and solutions for Open Data. The event is open to makers of all tribes. In the run-up we'll form teams around the most popular ideas and you'll be able to contribute your wit and skills to the project of your choosing. If you have an Open Data idea that just needs a couple of people and a weekend to realise, propose it at Make.01 and let's make it happen!</p>

                    <h2>Concept</h2>
                    <p>Open Data is the idea that certain data (non-personal) should be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish, without restrictions from copyright, patents or other control mechanisms. The value of this idea is that it improves transparency (What are my taxes being spent on?), it can optimize existing industries (What should hospitals specialise in?), or create new ones (How do public transport providers get me from A to B?).</p>
                    <p>At Make.01 we'll write applications, liberate data, create visualizations and publish analyses using open data to show support for and encourage the adoption of open data policies.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Who is this for?</h3>
                    <p>Developers get crafty at hackathons, service designers have their 'Global Jam', Data Scientists route cars at Traffic Camp, and entrepeneurs launch ideas over a StartUp Weekend. For many disciplines and niches, there are events where over the course of the weekend attendees learn about or develope something in their niche. Make.01 is all that, but isn't restricted or reducable to a formula like 'Business + Design + Technology'.
                    <p>Open Data can be sourced and built on in any domain or industry, so this event is open to anyone who has an idea for using open data, wants to find an interesting project to contribute towards, learn about how to visualize or analyze data or simply want to see what's happening.</p>
                    <p>OpenData is a truly cross-disciplanery affair so that's why we expect that Developers, Statisticians, Journalists, Designers, and Citizens alike will each contribute their skills to the projects at Make.01</p>

                    <h3>How will it work?</h3>
                    <p>In the open data pipeline, 

                        of open data is a function of its impact in peopleâ€™s lives.

                    As a fairly recent development, Open Data best practices are being pioneered in Canada, US, UK and the EU. 

                    Government surely isn't the only provider of Open Data, but in Hong Kong HKGov's Data.One initiative is the most concentrated effort </p>

                    </p>
                    <p>As a faily recent development, there are still a lot of outstanding issues with the open data 'pipeline'. From creation to distribution, from appropriation to consumption. While the 'appropriation' stage is the most natural for makers to step in There are many stages at which

                <h3>Catalyst Night</h3>
                <h4>Tuesday, 14 May @ The Good Lab</h4>
                <p>The Catalyst night is a precursor to Make.01 where participants propose their projects and form teams. We poll interest for each suggested project - you can propose as many as you like - and cull the ones which have too few supporters.</p>
                <p>We'll end with a solid set of feasible projects that have sufficient backers to be completed over the weekend. As some project may take fewer people and less time to complete, we'll also try to come up with a sensible schedule for spreading them out over the weekend. Anyone got a fancy algorythm for that?</p>
                <p>For the uninitiated - that'd be all of us really - we'll have a primer on the scope of Open Data and delineate what sorts of issues and applications you can address at Make.01. We'll also introduce you to some of Hong Kong's OpenData datasets, tools and applications currently available.</p>
                <p>The catalyst night is held earlier on in the week so you can take care of the more mundane preparations before Make.01 (e.g. printing templates, setting up a development environment, setting on a tool chain) and just spend the weekend making.</p>

Before dinner, we'll get together to hear how each project is developing. Each team delivers a short, 2 minute presentation on where they are at, and what challenges they're facing.</p>
                <p>To make sure everyone gets to their accomodation in time, we close shop half an hour before the last MTR passes by Cheung Sha Wan.</p>

Sunday is the recommended day for short trackers to participate as it's still possible to present the project at day's end.

                        <p>The immediate purpose of Make.01 is to provide makers with a time, a venue and the collaborators for them to realise their Open Data related ideas. Make.01 is thus organised for the benefit and enjoyment of its particiants as we believe that if you provide them with those bare essentials, beautiful and worthwhile things will happen.</p>
                        <p>The broader objective is to foster a community of makers and Open Data advocates who can further advance the adoption of Open Data in Hong Kong.</p>

                        <p>We take a very broad definition of making. Any creative act where you devise and implement an idea falls within the purvue of making. Making is as much about the practice of tinkering, playing with available tools and developing your own, as it is about building the end product.</p<p>Whether the result is thus a set of definitions, a icongraphic language, a web entity, a physicial object, or a friendly robot, you've <em>made</em> it if it came about through an iterative problem solving process where often the biggest challenge was to make everything work together. In sum, Making is ascending above the limitations of what you're given.<<p>As long as you believe your project fits that description, it's feasible to deliver over a weekend, and is relevant to Open Data, then it's the perfect project for Make.01.</p>

If you have an interest in or ideas for what Open Data can do for government, citizens and business, check out some of the <a href="#projects">proposed projects</a> and see if there's any which you could contribute to. There's some which focus on figuring out how Open Data can be improved in Hong Kong. These could benefit from your experience, research, and analytical skills. Also don't knock Make.01 as an opportunity to pick up new skills! In the maker spirit, propose a simple data visualistion project, or join an existing one and learn from the people around you!</<p>If you are still not sure whether the event is for you, perhaps sign up for short track tickets and attend for one day only.</p>

One of them is this very web site which can serve as a repository of Open Data resources and projects relevant to Hong Kong.<<p>The Make.01 projects will first appear on this website as suggestions, when they are picked up by a team they will be featured on this page as one of the outcomes of the event. If the team is willing to develop the project beyond Make.01, or it is already finalised, they'll have the opportunity to be featured in our Open Data projects index.
